
Word Count, a common utility on UniX/Linux systems, is a small program
called "wc" 

This program analyzes a file to determine the number of lines, words, and characters contained therein. 

Write your own version of wc. 
The program should 
- accept a file name as input and then 
- print three numbers showing the count of lines, words, and characters in the file.

You could use this file, WordCounts.txt, as the input and put it under same directory of your python program.
